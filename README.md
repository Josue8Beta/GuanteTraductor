# GuanteTraductor
This project develops an embedded system for hand gesture recognition, using flexible sensors and an MPU6050 inertial sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. The collected information is normalized and processed to feed a machine learning model pre-trained with proprietary data captured in different experimental sessions. This model was developed in TensorFlow and converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for integration and subsequent inference within a mobile application developed in Flutter.

The complete system captures sensor data, runs inference in real time using the TFLite model, and sends prediction results to Firebase for cloud storage. The mobile application allows users to view, download, and analyze the recognized gestures. The entire workflow, from data capture to inference, has been optimized to run on low-power systems, such as the ESP32, and on Android mobile devices.
